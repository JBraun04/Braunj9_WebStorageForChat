## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This was quite an interesting and fun assignment to work on. Now I now a bit more about how real-word applications such as these are made.
The assignment was not too difficult, and the example code in the instructions was beneficial since it showed me the concept of how the different functions help the application perform.

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
This bootsrap class specifies the font class and weight for a header. Similar to HTML's h1,h2, and so on, bootstrap has display-1, display-2, display-3, and display-4.
